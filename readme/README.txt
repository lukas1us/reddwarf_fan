Red Dwarf fanpage

Red Dwarf fanpage is my first project - single page website.
For this project I used both HTML5 and CSS3. At the end I added script.js (JQuery) to add some additional features such as quotes in header, adding classes onScroll, onClick event.

Features:
- responsive for both tablets and smartphones
- basic CSS animations => hover, transform, transition, scale, color
- iframe YT
- when scrolling header stays on top and changes BG color and font color (onScroll event add class to header) 
- changing quotes from array every 8 secondns
- hamburger => responsive menu
